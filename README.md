# Comparison of Double Factor Rotation Methods

- This is the topic of my bachelorâ€™s thesis. I wanted to write an ambitious, rigorous thesis, in which I was assisted by a professor from MIMUW.  
- The analyses for the thesis were conducted using the R programming language.  
- Working on the topic taught me a lot about factor analysis and gave me a solid foundation in conducting scientific literature reviews.
